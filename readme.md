# Today I Learned

This is a place where I store short descriptions of things I learn each day.
<br />&mdash;Doeke Zanstra.

## Guidelines

Should be factoids that you expect to need to refer to again. Hence, any factoid that is "Well that's interesting!" but would *never* be referenced again is NOT wanted here. So they mostly end up being technical things.

The folder structure means things are categorised by ONE main topic, not tagged with endless topics/subtopics.
