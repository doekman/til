Handling Files
==============

This is about Mac OS X and the Terminal.


File Metadata
-------------

With the command **mdls** you can lookup file metadata on Mac OS X. For example, 
with `mdls -name kMDItemVersion MyPdfFile.pdf`, you can determine the PDF version. 
Omitting the `-name value` part, lists all properties of the file.
